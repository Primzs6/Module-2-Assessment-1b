    <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous great apes that inhabit the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa.
         The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five
          subspecies. They are the largest living primates. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to
           99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos. 

         </p>
   <p>The eastern gorilla is more darkly coloured than the western gorilla, with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all. The mountain 
       gorilla also has the thickest hair. The western lowland gorilla can be brown or grayish with a reddish forehead. In addition, gorillas
        that live in lowland forest are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern gorilla also has a longer
         face and broader chest than the western gorilla.[29] Like humans, gorillas have individual fingerprints.[30][31] Their eye colour
          is dark brown, framed by a black ring around the iris. Gorilla facial structure is described as mandibular prognathism, that is,
           the mandible protrudes farther out than the maxilla. Adult males also have a prominent sagittal crest. </p>
